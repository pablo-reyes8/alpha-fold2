    Canonical AlphaFold2-style Evoformer block.

    Order
    -----
    1) MSA Row Attention with Pair Bias
    -> residual update on m
    Uses the current pair representation z as a bias to refine the MSA
    representation row-wise.

    2) MSA Column Attention
    -> residual update on m
    Mixes information across MSA sequences at each residue position.

    3) MSA Transition
    -> residual update on m
    Position-wise feed-forward transformation on the MSA representation.

    4) Outer Product Mean
    -> residual update on z
    Main bridge from MSA space to pair space.
    Converts information from m into pairwise signals and injects them into z.
    Intuitively, it summarizes co-evolutionary patterns across the MSA and
    uses them to refine residue-pair features.

    5) Triangle Multiplication Outgoing
    -> residual update on z
    Refines pair features through triangular message passing.
    For a target pair (i, j), the pair (i, j) is fixed and a third residue k
    is scanned over. The update is built from relations such as (i, k) and
    (j, k), i.e. two edges pointing toward k.

    6) Triangle Multiplication Incoming
    -> residual update on z
    Complementary triangular message passing on z.
    For a target pair (i, j), the pair (i, j) is fixed and a third residue k
    is scanned over. The update is built from relations such as (k, i) and
    (k, j), i.e. two edges coming from k.

    In both triangle multiplication modules:
    - the target pair (i, j) is fixed
    - k is the intermediate residue that is scanned / aggregated over

    7) Triangle Attention Starting Node
    -> residual update on z
    Triangle-aware self-attention on pair features.
    For a target pair (i, j), z[i, j] is the pair being updated, and attention
    is performed over relations of the form (i, k). In other words, the query
    comes from the target pair z[i, j], while keys/values come from other pair
    vectors z[i, k] along the same starting node i.

    8) Triangle Attention Ending Node
    -> residual update on z
    Complementary triangle-aware self-attention on pair features.
    For a target pair (i, j), z[i, j] is the pair being updated, and attention
    is performed over relations of the form (k, j). The query comes from the
    target pair z[i, j], while keys/values come from other pair vectors z[k, j]
    along the same ending node j.

    9) Pair Transition
    -> residual update on z
    Position-wise feed-forward transformation on the pair representation.

    Summary
    -------
    - m is the MSA representation.
    - z is the pair representation.
    - Outer Product Mean is the main MSA -> pair bridge.
    - Triangle modules refine z by reasoning over residue triples (i, j, k).
    - In triangle attention, attention is not applied to a single pair vector alone:
    z[i, j] is the target/query pair, and it attends over related pair vectors
    such as z[i, k] or z[k, j].

    Simplified Order

    1) MSA Row Attention with Pair Bias   -> residual on m
    2) MSA Column Attention               -> residual on m
    3) MSA Transition                     -> residual on m
    4) Outer Product Mean                 -> residual on z, and serves as the
                                            main bridge from m to z
    5) Triangle Multiplication Outgoing   -> residual on z
    6) Triangle Multiplication Incoming   -> residual on z
    7) Triangle Attention Starting Node   -> residual on z
    8) Triangle Attention Ending Node     -> residual on z
    9) Pair Transition                    -> residual on z
